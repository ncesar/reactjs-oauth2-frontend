## Overview

This is a simple ReactJS project made with the current functionalities:

1. Login/logout based on an endpoint
2. Search/filter through api items
3. Context API
4. React Router DOM

I had an external backend with OAuth 2.0 working and I had to make a login fucntion and also only show api items if the user was authenticated.

## Overview

This is a simple ReactJS project made with the current functionalities:

1. Login/logout based on an endpoint
2. Search/filter through api items
3. Context API
4. React Router DOM

I had an external backend with OAuth 2.0 working and I had to make a login handler and also only show api items if the user was authenticated.

Since this API is not hosted by me, it can be offline by the time you enter here to take a look but the code is always here so go check it out :)
